# Libation Web UI — Docker

A Dockerized web UI wrapper for [Libation](https://github.com/rmcrackan/Libation) by [@rmcrackan](https://github.com/rmcrackan).

> **Attribution:** This project depends entirely on [LibationCli](https://github.com/rmcrackan/Libation), the headless CLI companion to Libation. All audiobook management, Audible authentication, library scanning, and DRM decryption is performed by LibationCli. This repository adds only a web interface on top of it.

---

## Features

- **Liberate view** — default landing page; shows your full Audible library with download status overlays (downloaded ✓, not downloaded ✕, in-progress spinner)
- **Filter & search** — filter by status (All / Downloaded / Not Downloaded / In Progress / Purchased / Audible Plus), search by title, filter by owner
- **Owner tabs** — link each web UI user to an Audible account; books are filterable by owner
- **Download management** — one-click download per book, Download All (uncapped), Download Next N (capped users); real-time progress bars (0–100%) via LibationBridge; 2-second polling while downloads are active
- **Mark as downloaded** — manually set a book's status so LibationCLI treats it as already liberated
- **Multi-select** — select individual books or Select All (across all pages), then bulk Mark Downloaded / Mark Not Downloaded
- **Per-page selector** — choose 24 / 48 / 96 / 200 books per page
- **Accounts page** — add or remove Audible accounts via `login-external` OAuth flow (3-step: form → copy URL → paste response); inline owner name input for accounts you added; amber banner prompts you to set your owner name if unset
- **Downloads page** — active queue with progress bars, failed/completed history, library scan trigger
- **Multi-user support** — admin can create/disable/delete users; per-user permission flags and 12-hour rolling download caps
- **User management** — set owner name and link each user to an Audible account
- **Settings** — Libation config passthrough, session management (list/revoke), 2FA setup, API docs
- **Auth** — JWT access tokens (15-min) + 60-day httpOnly refresh cookies, optional TOTP 2FA
- **Dark mode** — persisted to localStorage, toggled from the sidebar
- **Unraid-ready** — PUID/PGID support, Community Applications template included

## Images

The image is published to two registries — use whichever you prefer:

| Registry | Image |
|----------|-------|
| Docker Hub | `jtechguru1993/libation-web:latest` |
| GitHub Container Registry | `ghcr.io/jtechguru1/libation-web:latest` |

Both are `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` multi-arch manifests. The GHCR image is
built and pushed automatically by
[`.github/workflows/docker-ghcr.yml`](.github/workflows/docker-ghcr.yml) on every
push to `web-ui-via-docker`, in addition to these tags:

| Tag | Produced by |
|-----|-------------|
| `latest` | every push to `web-ui-via-docker` |
| `web-ui-via-docker` | every push to that branch |
| `sha-<full-commit-sha>` | every push, for pinning an exact build |
| `1.2.3`, `1.2` | pushing a `v1.2.3` git tag |

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Clone and configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set a strong SECRET_KEY and change the admin credentials

# Start
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` — log in with your configured credentials, then go to **Accounts** to connect your Audible account.

## Volume layout

| Host path      | Container path | Purpose                              |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `./data`       | `/data`       | App database (users, sessions)       |
| `./config`     | `/config`     | Libation config + `LibationContext.db`  |
| `./audiobooks` | `/audiobooks` | Downloaded audiobook files           |

---

## Logging

All LibationCLI command output (scans, downloads, account logins) is written to a rotating log file on the `/config` volume, so it survives container restarts and is readable without SSH access — useful for debugging on Unraid.

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Log file (in container) | `/config/logs/libation-web.log` |
| Log file (Unraid host)  | `/mnt/user/appdata/libation/config/logs/libation-web.log` |
| In-app viewer | **Settings → Logs** (admin only) — filter by level, adjust line count, download raw file |

Rotates at 5MB, keeps 3 backups (`libation-web.log`, `.1`, `.2`, `.3`). OAuth tokens and login response URLs are never logged.

---

## Adding an Audible account

1. Go to **Accounts** → **Add Account**
2. Enter your Audible email and marketplace
3. Copy the login URL → open it in your browser and sign in
4. Paste the response URL back → account is connected
5. A banner will prompt you to go to **Downloads** → **Scan Library** to import your books

## Environment variables

| Variable                      | Default      | Description                                        |
|-------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `SECRET_KEY`                  | (required)   | JWT signing key — **generate a strong random value** |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME`              | `admin`      | Initial admin username — only used on **first run** (before `app.db` exists); ignored after that |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD`              | `admin`      | Initial admin password — only used on **first run**; to change after first run use Settings → Change Password |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | `15`         | Access token lifetime                              |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS`   | `60`         | Refresh token / session lifetime                   |
| `PUID`                        | `1000`       | User ID for file ownership (Unraid: 99)            |
| `PGID`                        | `1000`       | Group ID for file ownership (Unraid: 100)          |

Generate a strong `SECRET_KEY`:
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

## Installing on Unraid

> **Note:** The image is published to Docker Hub as `jtechguru1993/libation-web:latest`
> and to GHCR as `ghcr.io/jtechguru1/libation-web:latest`.

### Step 1 — Add the container

1. In the Unraid web UI go to the **Docker** tab
2. Click **Add Container**

Fill in these basic fields:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | `LibationWeb` |
| Repository | `jtechguru1993/libation-web:latest` |
| Network Type | `Bridge` |
| Web UI | `http://[IP]:[PORT:8000]/` |

---

### Step 2 — Port mapping

Click **Add another Path, Port, Variable, Label or Device** → select **Port**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Container Port | `8000` |
| Host Port | `8000` |
| Protocol | `TCP` |

---

### Step 3 — Volume paths

Add three paths via **Add another Path, Port, Variable, Label or Device** → **Path**:

**1. App database** (users, sessions, download history)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Container Path | `/data` |
| Host Path | `/mnt/user/appdata/libation/data` |
| Access Mode | Read/Write |

**2. Libation config** (Audible account tokens, book database, **and app logs** — no separate path needed for logging, it lives at `/config/logs/libation-web.log` inside this same volume)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Container Path | `/config` |
| Host Path | `/mnt/user/appdata/libation/config` |
| Access Mode | Read/Write |

**3. Audiobooks** (downloaded files)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Container Path | `/audiobooks` |
| Host Path | `/mnt/user/audiobooks` |
| Access Mode | Read/Write |

> Change `/mnt/user/audiobooks` to match your actual media share path on Unraid.

---

### Step 4 — Environment variables

Add each via **Add another Path, Port, Variable, Label or Device** → **Variable**:

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `PUID` | `99` | Unraid's standard `nobody` user — leave as `99` |
| `PGID` | `100` | Unraid's standard `users` group — leave as `100` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | *(make one up — see below)* | **Required** |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | `admin` | Your admin login username |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | *(strong password)* | **Do not leave as default** |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | `15` | Leave as default |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS` | `60` | Leave as default |

**Setting your SECRET_KEY:**
Make up any random string of 32 or more characters and type it in. Letters, numbers, and symbols like `!@#%^&*-_+=` are all fine. Just avoid `"` (double quote), `$` (dollar sign), `\` (backslash), and spaces as these can cause issues in environment variables.

Example of a valid key: `k7m2p9q4n8r3t6w1x5y0z2a4b7c9d1e3`

> The SECRET_KEY signs your login tokens. It never needs to be remembered or typed again — just make it random and don't share it.

---

### Step 5 — Apply and open

Click **Apply**. Unraid will pull the image and start the container. Once it shows as running, open:

```
http://[your-unraid-ip]:8000
```

Log in with your `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

---

### Step 6 — First-time setup

1. Go to **Accounts** → **Add Account** and connect your Audible account
2. After login completes a banner will appear — click through to **Downloads** → **Scan Library**
3. Once the scan finishes your books appear on the **Liberate** page ready to download

If something goes wrong, logs are at `/mnt/user/appdata/libation/config/logs/libation-web.log` on the host, or in-app under **Settings → Logs** — no SSH needed. See [Logging](#logging) above.
